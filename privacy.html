        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <p>This privacy policy applies to the Casual Helper app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Christopher De Jong (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        
        <p>The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)</li>
            <li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages</li>
            <li>The time spent on the Application</li>
            <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Location Data</h3>
        
        <p>The Application collects your device's location, which helps the Service Provider determine your approximate geographical location and make use of it in the following ways:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Map Services</strong>: Location data is used to show your position on terminal maps and calculate distances to terminals</li>
            <li><strong>Navigation Features</strong>: Location data enables navigation assistance and directional indicators</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced User Experience</strong>: Location data helps provide relevant terminal information based on your proximity</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Location data is processed locally on your device and is not stored permanently or transmitted to external servers.</p>

        <h3>Subscription Information</h3>
        
        <p>The Application offers premium subscriptions processed through Apple's App Store. The Service Provider receives confirmation of your subscription status from Apple but does not have access to your payment information, which is handled entirely by Apple.</p>

        <h2>Third Party Access</h2>
        
        <p>The Service Provider does not share your personal information with third parties except:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Apple App Store</strong>: For subscription processing and app distribution</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process</li>
            <li><strong>Safety</strong>: When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect rights, safety, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>
        
        <p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>
        
        <p>You can disable location access at any time through your device's settings.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>
        
        <p>The Service Provider will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. If you'd like us to delete User Provided Data that you have provided via the Application, please contact us at christopherdj77@hotmail.com and we will respond in a reasonable time.</p>

        <h2>Children</h2>
        
        <p>The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.</p>
        
        <p>The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. We encourage all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to us through the Application, please contact us at christopherdj77@hotmail.com so that we will be able to take the necessary actions.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        
        <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. The Service Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>

        <h2>Your Consent</h2>
        
        <p>By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.</p>
